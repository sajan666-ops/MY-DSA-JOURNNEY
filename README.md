## 🚀 About This Repository
Welcome to **My DSA Journey**, a public log of my grind towards mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms**, not by random problems but by **recognizing patterns that scale**.

This repo is not a LeetCode dump.  
It’s a **strategic arsenal of problem-solving patterns**—the exact mindset shift that bridges a **college coder to an Apple Engineer.**

## 📚 Pattern-Focused Structure
Every folder here represents a **Pattern**, not just a problem category.

| Folder Name               | Pattern Description                                                   | Status    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **TWO POINTER**            | Efficient in-place algorithms using left & right pointers.            | ✅ Done    |
| **SLIDING WINDOW**         | Dynamic subarray problems optimized for O(1) space windowing.         | 🚧 Pending |
| **BINARY SEARCH**          | Divide & conquer approach to search in sorted spaces.                 | 🚧 Pending |
| **DFS / BFS (Graph Traversal)** | Navigating graphs and trees recursively or iteratively.           | 🚧 Pending |
| **HASHING TECHNIQUES**     | Optimal lookup strategies using HashMaps & HashSets.                  | 🚧 Pending |
| **DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING**    | Optimizing recursive problems by memorization and tabulation.         | 🚧 Pending |

## 🧠 Philosophy: "I'm into Patterns than Numbers"
While most chase LeetCode numbers, this journey is about:
- **Recognizing the underlying algorithm patterns.**
- **Mastering them so deeply that problem statements become irrelevant.**
- **Building DSA intuition that scales from interviews to real-world Apple-level coding.**

---

## 🏁 Goal:
- Complete **Core + Intermediate DSA Patterns** before interviews.
- Solve problems that **mirror Apple Interview Challenges.**
- Make this repo a **solid DSA Pattern Guide** for anyone tired of random problem-hopping.

## ⚡ How to Navigate This Repo?
1. Go to a **Pattern Folder**.
2. Inside, you’ll find:
   - Problem Statements (Link)
   - Solution Code (Swift / Python)
   - Pattern Explanation in README.md
3. Follow the journey, **commit by commit.**

## 🌍 Why Public?
Because **accountability is the best motivator.**  
Every push, every commit is a reminder that:
> **"Someone out there is watching this journey unfold. Might as well give them a show worth remembering."**
